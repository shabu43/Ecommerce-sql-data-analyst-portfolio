Hi there!

Based on your bounce rate analysis, we ran a new custom landing page (`/lander-1`) in a **50/50 test** against the homepage (`/home`) for our gsearch nonbrand traffic.

Can you pull **bounce rates for the two groups** so we can evaluate the new page?

Make sure to just look at the **test period**, so it’s a fair comparison.

Thanks!
