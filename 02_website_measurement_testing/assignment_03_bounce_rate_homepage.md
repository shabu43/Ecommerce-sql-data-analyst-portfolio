Hi there!

You mentioned earlier that all of our traffic is landing on the homepage.  
We should check how that page is performing.

Can you pull **bounce rates for sessions landing on the homepage**?  
I'd like to see three metrics:  
1. Sessions  
2. Bounced Sessions  
3. % of Sessions which Bounced

Thanks!  
â€“ Morgan
