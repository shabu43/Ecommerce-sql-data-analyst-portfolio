Hi there,

After your device-level analysis of conversion rates, we bid up our gsearch nonbrand **desktop campaigns** on **2012-05-19**.

Can you pull **weekly trends** for both **desktop and mobile** to see the impact on volume?

Letâ€™s use **2012-04-15 to 2012-05-19** as a baseline for comparison.

Thanks,  
Tom
