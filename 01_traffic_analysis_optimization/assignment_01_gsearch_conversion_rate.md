Hi there,

Sounds like *gsearch nonbrand* is our major traffic source, but we need to understand if those sessions are driving sales.

Could you calculate the **conversion rate (CVR)** from session to order?  
We’ll need a CVR of at least **4%** to justify our spend.

If we’re much lower, we’ll need to reduce bids.  
If we’re higher, we can increase bids to drive more volume.

Thanks,  
Tom
