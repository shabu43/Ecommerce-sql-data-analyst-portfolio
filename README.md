# Ecommerce-sql-data-analyst-portfolio


Welcome to my comprehensive SQL portfolio project, based on a real-world eCommerce simulation from Maven Analytics. This repository showcases a wide range of hands-on business analysis tasks using **advanced MySQL queries**, built for aspiring **Data Analysts** and **Business Intelligence professionals**.

## Project Overview

As the newly hired **Database Analyst** at *Maven Fuzzy Factory*, an online eCommerce start-up, my mission is to help the team grow the business by:

- Analyzing marketing performance
- Understanding user behavior
- Optimizing conversion funnels
- Analyzing product trends and seasonal behavior

Each task in this portfolio is structured as a **business scenario**, typically sent via email from key stakeholders such as the **CEO**, **Marketing Director**, or **Website Manager**. The tasks include the original email scenario, SQL-based solutions, and actionable insights.
